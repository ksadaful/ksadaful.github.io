                <br>
                Our company offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to university students looking to gain invaluable
                insight into the world of consulting. The mentors volunteering at ECG are professionals from a diverse
                array of industries, many of them Fortune 500 companies, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and
                McKinsey. In addition to receiving priceless career advice through the mentorship program, students will
                also get the chance to develop the kind of soft skills that every company is looking for and every
                successful individual needs-skills which cannot be learned in a classroom. Furthermore, students get a
                chance to work with other multi-talented, passionate, HKU students who also want to make a difference in
                their community by providing pro-bono services to worthy causes across Hong Kong.

                <br>
                At ECG, each Consulting Team consists of three consulting roles, namely Lead Consultant, Consultant and
                Mentor. <br><br>
                <b> Lead Consultant </b>: In addition to all of the responsibilities of a Consultant, Lead Consultants
                are
                expected to take charge of the consulting team and see the project through from conception to
                completion. The LC will liaise directly with the client to obtain the necessary information to carry out
                the project, as well as ensure that the progress of the project is in line with the client's
                expectations. The most important aspect of the role is to effectively manage the consulting team in
                order to ensure efficient execution of the project objectives. The LC reports directly to the team's
                supervisor and mentors regularly.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Consultant</b>: The consultants will work as part of the consulting team
                in order to research, investigate, and formulate solutions to the client's problems. Emphasis is placed
                on the preparation of high quality deliverables that directly address the issues outlined in the project
                proposal.
                <br> <br>
                <b>Mentor</b>: Mentors, who are working professionals, are assigned to each consulting team. They
                will aid the consultants in the project by assisting them when they are defining the scope of the
                project with the client. The mentors will be available to meet at least once a month with the team and
                are expected to respond to urgent queries via email from time to time. The mentors will monitor the
                team's work progress and will give advice on how to improve it at each meeting. At the end of the
                project, they will evaluate the performance of the consultants and give them feedback.

                <h4 align="center">Training Regime</h4>
                <br>
                Students who make it through ECG's rigorous recruitment process do not have to worry about potentially
                lacking experience in the field of consulting. Every Wednesday between 7-9 PM, consultants are required
                to attend a training session- this will last for ten weeks. Each weekly training session is specially
                designed to help consultants tackle their problems in the order that they usually appear over the course
                of a client engagement. For each session, at least one guest speaker is brought in to help students
                navigate their problems. Previous speakers include Eva Yung, Regional HR Development Manager at Moet
                Hennessy Asia Pacific and Arthur Shek, Engagement Director at McKinsey & Company. Topics covered in our
                regime include "The 7 Steps of Consulting", data analysis and how to structure the final deliverables.
                One key component of our training regime is Speed Consulting. Consultants are required to attend this
                event once every cycle. Once there, each consulting team will give an elevator pitch to mentors and/or
                distinguished guest speakers and receive feedback on their progress. This is designed to help
                consultants receive advice on how best to move forward on their project, as well as get some valuable
                face-time with industry professionals from a diverse array of fields. In addition to training sessions,
                our online Knowledge Management System is another key component of training regime. Consultants can
                access to multiple training materials and experience sharing files to further develop their knowledge of
                a consulting career.
                <br><br>
                With the ECG Training Regime, we are convinced that consultants of ECG will be empowered to deliver
                effective solutions for our clients to maximize their social impact.

                include helping students define the scope of their engagement with the client, actively giving advice to
                consulting teams, engaging in client meetings, and helping students develop the soft-skills needed to
