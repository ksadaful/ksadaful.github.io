                Diversity, collaboration and pro bono work: these are the three pillars of the Eureka Consulting Group.
                Handpicked from a large range of faculties, our consultants come from diverse backgrounds, which we
                believe will contribute to the success of each consulting project as a fresh pair of eyes always offers
                more innovative solutions.
                At ECG, we provide a platform for passionate students to collaborate with professionals to work towards
                achieving the same goal: helping the client.

                Last but not least, we aim to provide our consulting services pro bono to organizations with social good
                missions but unfortunately lack the financial means to afford them. The pro bono culture is ingrained in
                the foundation of ECG and is shared by all our members.
                As Managing Director, I believe that it is important to give back to society, to actively reach out and
                help non-profit organizations, and to provide tailored solutions, which have direct social impact on our
                clients. <br> <br>
                Our operational model at ECG allows all three parties involved: clients, consultants and mentors
                (professionals), to benefit from the consulting projects &#45; or as we call it, our win-win-win model.
                Experiential learning is a very unique opportunity provided at ECG, specifically targeting students who
                are willing to learn and develop their soft skills through actual interaction with a client. The
                responsibilities of carrying out the services are in the hands of the consultants as the lead consultant
                takes charge and spearheads the whole operation. I believe that it is important to let the consultants
                take ownership of their own project and give them freedom to derive their own solutions.
                Our consultants volunteer to dedicate their time to serve our clients pro bono in an intense consulting
                process of 8-10 weeks. The recruitment process is thus very competitive and we place emphasis on
                open-mindedness, leadership qualities, passion, creative thinking and excellent language skills. Since
                the beginning of the second cycle, we have enhanced the unique experiential learning by implementing the
                Mentorship Programme. Each consulting team is now paired with at least two mentors. This not only opens
                the door to tackle more challenging issues for the client but also allows the mentors to guide and
                cultivate their consultants in preparation for their future careers. Similarly, ECG provides the mentors
                with an avenue to use their expert knowledge to help the clients, and gaining job satisfaction is as an
                additional bonus. <br> <br>
                Having witnessed and helping to nourish the journey ECG has undergone since its incorporation, I am
                honoured to be entrusted the role of Managing Director. I would like to thank my predecessor, Suhail
                Bindra, for setting up this organization, and for nurturing and building ECG to what it is today. I hope
                that ECG continues to spread the pro bono culture and inspire the Hong Kong community to dedicating
                their time and skills to do more social work. With the support from my colleagues, faculty members and
                professionals, I am confident that our organization will continue to succeed in our upcoming cycles and
                turn our visions into reality.
