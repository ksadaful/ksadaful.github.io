                <br>
                Our consulting services focus on our clients' most pressing needs and opportunities in the following
                areas:
                <h5> Strategy Development </h5>
                The Eureka Consulting Group specializes in providing cutting-edge social media branding
                strategies-utilizing
                Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn to help our clients spread their message, as well as more traditional
                methods such as the distribution of promotional material, online advertisements, and email lists. We are
                also highly experienced in providing fundraising strategies, from how to effectively carry out flag
                days, to raffles, as well as brainstorm unique events that can be held annually. Our hand-picked and
                highly
                trained consulting teams provide invaluable information to our clients every step of the way in order to
                ensure
                the successful implementation of their marketing campaign. If necessary, ECG can look over our clients'
                books and financial reports in order to analyze how to efficiently allocate resources to different
                programs by
                creating sustainable system that the client can follow even after ECG's services are no longer required.
                <h5> Performance Improvement </h5>
                ECG can research and produce a marketing scheme designed to cut costs and grow sales in the most
                efficient manner possible. We have experience in researching online and offline marketing strategies in
                order to
                increase traffic to their onsite location and/or their website. Furthermore, our consulting teams are
                extremely skilled at designing well-structured customer surveys to see where the organization is
                successful and in what areas it needs improvement. Our clients will have the benefit of having
                consultants with a
                deep understanding of Google Analytics, use their knowledge to help their company climb up Google's
                search
                results.
                <h5> Legal and Financial Research </h5>
                Under the guidance of our mentors, we can interpret legal engagements and explicate them to our clients
                in
                the simplest way possible. If necessary, we can offer advice on how to incorporate a company under Hong
                Kong's laws, as well as how to obtain tax-exempt status. Our consulting teams specialize in analyzing
                our
                clients' financial health in order to provide advice on how to further advance their operation.
                Consulting projects will typically last 8-16 weeks. Services of solutions implementation may be provided
                after the consulting period. All profits are donated to charitable organizations with the primary
                purpose of
                improving the human condition. Our primary deliverables to the client include a report and presentation.
                The
                report and presentation, prepared by a handpicked consulting team of 5-6 members (with one member being
                a
                graduate MBA student), will address all of the issues and concerns of the client and provide practicable
                solutions to them. The client may then choose to enter into a supplementary contract with ECG in order
                to
                implement the practicable solutions contained in the final report, should they find the recommendations
                are
                to their liking. The billing for the supplementary contract will be discretionary depending on the
                particular nature of services demanded.

                We appreciate proactive potential clients reaching out to us for an engagement. We highly recommend you
                to look at our “Our Services” section above as well as talk to our previous clients so that you know
                what we specialize in and whether we can be an asset to your organization. As a gentle reminder, we run
                on an academic semester basis, whereby the first cycle of each year starts in September and the second
                cycle starts in February. If you would like to become a client for the upcoming semester, please contact
                us at least one month before the start date in order to sort out all the necessary procedures in time.
                Our engagement also requires one person in your organisation to be ECG’s point of contact – it would
                benefit us both greatly if you and your consulting team maintain a good rapport during the whole
                engagement. At ECG, we have a very simple 3-step process for clients who wish to contract for our
                services. <br> <br>
                Please contact the Head of Engagement at engagement@ecg.hk and explain the types of services your
                organisation is looking for. ECG will contact you and a mutually exploratory meeting will be arranged.
                ECG will prepare a proposal outlining at most, 5 different issues the project will deal with. It will
                later be determined between the client and their consulting team whether to narrow down to fewer issues
                and/or how to prioritise them. ECG and the client must agree on all terms in the proposal before
                proceeding further. <br> <br>
                ECG will send the client the final proposal, two contractual documents (Terms of Service and Engagement
                Letter), along with the invoice for the engagement. Upon signing of the contract, ECG also requires the
                client to hand over necessary documents (such as financial audits) to carry out the project, so that we
                can brief our consultants on them to ensure an efficient start. The client will be introduced to their
                consulting team after our selection process (normally one week before the start date).

                Our consultants are key to our purpose. We have put in place a stringent recruitment process that allows
                us to screen "la creme de la creme" at the first and foremost university in Asia. We look for students
                who are not only smart but also street-smart, who have an eye for details, excellent analytical and
                problem-solving skills and who can communicate their thoughts clearly. We recruit from a variety of
                academic backgrounds and we form our consulting teams by bringing together different minds with
                different perspectives and yet, who can work together for the benefits of our clients.

                Our mission is to provide low-cost meaningful consultancy services to NGOs, SMEs, social enterprises,
                charitable institutions and governmental or quasi-governmental bodies. We maintain services of a stellar
                standard at such a low cost as we are in receipt of numerous grants and other forms of support from the
                University of Hong Kong. Our consultants and advisory board members, for the most part, donate their
                time to ECG as they believe in our cause as strongly as we do. On a client by client basis, at the
                absolute discretion of ECG, we offer our services free of charge given the objects of the client are
                also purely charitable and/or align with the objects of ECG. Clients that fit in this category are open
                to donate whatever amount they wish to ECG as a gesture of good faith. For SMEs and other clients that
                do not operate for solely charitable purposes, we have a standard charge that may vary between HKD 2000
                and HKD 6000, depending on the size of the organization and the nature of the work. Any surplus funds
                will be used by ECG to further its objects and/or for solely charitable purposes. Please note that these
                figures and statements are for reference only, and ECG reserves the right to amend the aforesaid
                statements and/or figures depending on the individual circumstances of each client. If you would like to
                receive a soft copy of our client prospectus, please make out your request to neetesh@ecg.hk. If you
                would like to receive a hard copy, please also include the following details in your email:
                <br> (i) Name of addressee
                <br> (ii) Organisation of the addressee
                <br> (iii) Postal address. <br>
                Please note that, as a matter
                of our environmental sustainability policy, we only send 1 prospectus to each prospective client.
